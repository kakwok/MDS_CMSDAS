title: "Introduction"
teaching: 30
exercises: 0
questions:
- Why do we search for long-lived particles?
- Why do we use muon detectors?
- What signatures are we looking for?
objectives:
- "Understand the motivation to search for LLPs with muon detectors"
- "Understand the high-multiplicity signature from LLPs due to the unique CMS muon detector design"
- "Have an understanding of the overall analysis strategy and background estimation"
keypoints:
- "Searching for LLPs with the CMS muon detectors that is interleaved with steel return yoke give rise to unique high multiplicity signature that allow us to be sensitive to a broad range of LLP decay modes and to LLP masses below GeV"

We will go through the [introductory slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1462056/contributions/6313496/attachments/2996184/5278686/CMSDAS_2025.pdf) to give you an overview of the motivation to search for LLP with the CMS muon detectors, the analysis strategy, background estimation methods, and limit setting on LLP cross section.
